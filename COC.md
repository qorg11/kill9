# kill-9 code of conduct

We at kill-9 think that it is important to have a civilized way of
doing stuff. Therefore, here are the kill-9 rules. They apply to our
irc and everything kill-9 related:

Number one: That's terror  
Number two: That's terror

(If you need a text to show you how to be human, examinate what you're
doing)

In other words: Above all. Respect
