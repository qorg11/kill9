# Getting help about Emacs

Emacs is a very big software and you'll surely will need help about
it. There are some ways to get help on Emacs.

## Self documenting text editor

Emacs claims to be a *self-documenting* text editor. And it's true:

Emacs has a lot of built-in documentation. For example. If you don't
know what the C-r keybindings do, you can do this:

C-h k C-r_

Emacs will split and will show what the keybindings you gave does.

Emacs has a built-in tutorial. You can access to it by pressing C-h t.

## Getting help from another users

You can talk to other Emacs users and ask them for help on some sites:

* [Emacs stack exchange](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/)
* [The help-gnu-emacs mailing list](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/)
* #emacs on freenode
