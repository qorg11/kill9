# Windows

Emacs allows you to open multiple files at once, or open irc in emacs while editing, which is very helpful. You can open a new one using C-x 3 ```(split-window-right)``` or C-x 2 `(split-window-below)`

You can also use C-x 1 `(delete-other-windows)`, which does exactly as it says it does, and deletes the other windows. 

You can also use C-x 4 f to open a file in the other window. It calls the function `(find-file-other-window)`
