# Download sidebery

This will add the sidebar where you can manage the tree styled tabs
and bookmarks. It's awesome and way better than the default tabs
management.

<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/>. 

Download. Install it and if don't appear. Press C-e, and your tabs will appear.

# Remove tab bar

In newer version of Firefox. You might need to set
toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets in
about:config I'm using Firefox 68 so i don't need to.

Go to your Firefox profile location
(~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxx-default) and create a folder named "chrome"

Inside that folder. Create a file named userChrome.css with the following contents:

~~~
#TabsToolbar {
  visibility: collapse;
}
#sidebar-box #sidebar-header {
  display: none !important;
}
~~~
