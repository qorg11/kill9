# How to make a GOOD website

In this thing. I'm implying you are not a corporate moron and you are making a personal website. (Please do. These are dying).

# Don't use JavaScript

[JavaScript](/harmful/software/javascript) is a shitty scripting language for the front end. But now it is used in the backend also. If you **MUST** use JavaScript (Which is perfectly understandable) please make sure that the website is completly usable without JavaScript

Some websites need to use JavaScript to load the content. Which is unforgivable. 

# Use human understandable interfaces

Use simple colors

Write in plan language ([Go to top] instead of weird svgs)

Use sentences ([Click here to view ommited posts] instead of weird walls of text)

Do not use javascript for things you can do in HTML (Instead of making a weird button in javascript. use ```<input type="button">```

And please. For satan's sake. DO NOT IMPLEMENT SMOOTH SCROLLING IN
JAVASCRIPT AAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHHHHH

# Make a .onion mirror of your website

i2p or freenet are okay too.

.onions are easy as shit to make. 

If your hosting provider does not provide a .onion interface. Consider
getting a VPS or self host your website with a Raspberry Pi.
