# Our noble soydev

![Tate on his trip to Finland](/burger.png)

Tate is a soydev but we love him. He writes C++ and JavaScript (He's
literally the opposite of what was stated in this website) but
nevertheless we love him. He tried to convert people to XMPP (And he
could!) but they no longer use it. Él habla español de forma graciosa
y hace "mistaques" porque a veces le enseño español mal para poder
reirme.

He has a eepsite (I host it for him...) and his website is a resume
not worth sharing because sadly there's nothing interesting on it. But
anyways click [here](https://dvtate.com)

He has real balls because he has a Lain picture in the part where a
pic of him is supposed to be.
