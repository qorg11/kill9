Radical servers comparision {#radical-servers-comparision-1}
===========================

This document pretends to show a comparision of the radical servers. At
least the one I\'ve used. I\'ll dig onto their privacy policy, what they
provide...

Riseup
======

RiseUp is an anarchocommunist radical server. It provides, for
registered users: E-Mail and XMPP. For unregistered users, it provides
mailing lists, VPN, pads, filesharing...

E-Mail
------

Their E-Mail servers is **really** good. You can have infinite aliases.
So you can use your riseup account without having to give your real
address. (You can delete adresses anytime)

XMPP
----

Riseup. I love you and all. But please, fix your XMPP server, it\'s
unusable:

-   Can\'t use HTTP File Upload

-   Does not support avatars in MUC

-   Does not support MUC

-   Does not support message carbons

    In other worse. Their XMPP could be **MUCH** better. I hope they fix
    it.

Privacy policy
--------------

-   No IP address log

Awesome. I don\'t do this either.

-   Keep \"From:\" and \"To:\" E-Mail headers to prevent spam

This is okay. I mean, even if you use PGP, the emails header cannot be
encrypted. Those logs are removed after a few days.

-   Last logins are in quarters.

Meaning they just log that you log once every 4 months. Which is good.

-   Data is encrypted. And only Riseup can decrypt it. Cool. Feds cannot
    break onto Riseup\'s

Riseup and government
---------------------

According to <https://riseup.net/en/about-us/policy/government-faq>,
Riseup would rather nuke their server than giving information to the
government.

If you do illegal things in Riseup (drugs, cheese pizza) (which, btw,
violates Riseup\'s TOS), riseup will most likely work with the feds to
stop you rather than nuking the organization.

Conclusion
----------

Riseup is literally the best thing you can do for E-Mail. **BUT** you
need to be invited to it. And no. the writer of this won\'t give you an
invite. Don\'t use this for XMPP.

Snopyta
=======

Snopyta provides way more services than Riseup (which doesn\'t means
it\'s better)

According to the privacy policy. \"No data will be ever shared\"

Searx
-----

I use the snopyta searx instance as my search engine. And I haven\'t had
a single problem with it. They **DON\'T** log any IP address or search
queries. But they really have to update the Searx version. So we can use
the morty proxy feature.

XMPP
----

I haven\'t used it. But a friend has. And he haven\'t had a single
problem with it. So I guess it is good. According to the
conversations.im compliance test. It has 100% of compliance.
Recommended. IP addresses are not stored in the server. Nice

E-Mail
------

Idk. I haven\'t use it, they aren\'t offering more accounts. But,
according to their privacy policy:

-   Emails are stored plain text unless you use PGP or something like
    that. But the drive where the mails are is encrypted. The sent and
    recieved logs are cleaned every 24 hours.

Mastodon
--------

I use the <https://social.snopyta.org> mastodon instance. By default.
nothing is stored in the server unless you create an account. According
to the mastodon privacy policy everything you post is stored in the
server (Including private messages). So don\'t use it for sensitive
things.

DNS services
------------

Nothing is logged. If there\'s some abuse, logs will be kept, but will
be nuked after 24 hours.


Kalli.st
----------

https://kalli.st provides various services. E-Mail, Git, XMPP,Pleroma
and lainsafe (:D)

I've only tried their E-Email and their Git, seems to work
properly. Also good luck getting an account.

Conclusion
----------

Use it for Searx and XMPP, maybe Mastodon if you want. They provide
more services. But they're require an account or are no too privacy
oriented. (RSS, for example) They also provide this pastebin which
uses AES256 encryption. And according to them. They have no way to
decrypt it.

If you don\'t trust their \"no logs\" policy, alright, they provide a
hidden service (.onion) for everything. So use that instead!

These are all the services I\'ve used for things. If I use more
services. I\'ll add them here.
