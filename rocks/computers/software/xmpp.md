# xmpp is the instant messaging protocol out thereÂ¹

The Extensible Messaging Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a messaging
protocol which allows you to... exchange message with a chat partner
and know if said partner is online, busy, away... At its core it is
very minimal. But as its name says, it is extensible so there are
extensions like multi user chats (MUCs) OpenPGP encryption, OMEMO
encryption, OTR encryption, profile pictures...

As it is a protocol rather than a software. There are a lot of clients
to choose from. To name a few, dino, gajim, profanity (for linux),
conversations for android, monal for the apple garbage...

# Descentralization

You and your friend can setup their own xmpp server and a server to
server communication will be made. (yourdomain.tld -> frendomain.tld)
just like emails. So the messages aren't centralizated. Making it good
for privacy

# Easy encryption

xmpp supports [OMEMO](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) and
[OpenPGP](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0027.html) encryption. This
plus centralization makes it perfect for privacy.
