# xmpp is the best software protocol out there

I have my reasons:

## Descentralization

You and your friend can setup their own xmpp server and a server to
server communication will be made. (yourdomain.tld -> frendomain.tld)
just like emails. So the messages aren't centralizated. Making it good
for privacy

## Easy encryption

xmpp supports [OMEMO](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) and
[OpenPGP](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0027.html) encryption. This
plus centralization makes it perfect for privacy.

## xmpp flaws

Every client sucks
