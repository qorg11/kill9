# Void linux rocks

Void linux it is a built from scratch GNU/Linux distribution made in
Spain by JuanRP (Who is not in the project anymore) and
contribuitors. Its main feature are:

* Its own package manager, the x binary package system (xbps). It is
  very fast unlike the insanely slow dnf or apt.
* A lot of packages avaiable for default. IceCat is in their main
  repositories. There's also i3-gaps.
* Insanely fast download servers.
* You can compile the packages by yourself with xbps-src.
* No systemd. It uses runit by default. (a GOOD init system).
* It does not use man-db.
* Easy installation. Unlike Arch or Gentoo.
* Very lightweight.
* Has non-free packages in a separate repository.

Void is a very good distro but it has very shitty stuff you may not deal with:

* For advanced users.
* No texlive in repos. You have to download and use the texlive
  installer script. Which is bad because it leads to descentralized
  packages.
* There are some useless packages in their repositories. Such as
  XMonad. It only install the binaries but not the required Haskell
  libraries XMonad needs to work.
  
That's all the bad things about Void, Void is one of the best distros
out there and it deserves a try.
