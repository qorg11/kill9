# Debian second best distro

Debian is a (very) old GNU/Linux distribution. Which has done a lot
(lot) to the Free Software movement. And we owe it almost every
GNU/Linux distribution. Such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Deepin. And many,
many more. It started in 1993 by Ian Murdock (‚úù). The name Debian is
the combination of his name and his girlfriend's name (Deborah + Ian)

There's the Debian Manifesto, which you can read
[here](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ap-manifesto.html)
Where a 100% Free (As in freedom) GNU/Linux distribution is stated.

There's also the DFSG (Debian Free Software guidelines). Which are the
guides that a package must follow for it to be considered Free
Software by Debian. I am not going to state them here. But you can read it [here](https://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines).

Debian has a lot of good stuff and a bit of bad stuff. But the bad
stuff can be easily fixed

* Since it is a very old GNU/Linux distribution, there's a lot of
  documentation written. So it is useful for new GNU/Linux users.
* Xorg just works.
* Lots of packages. 
* Runs on everything. Almost as NetBSD, and not planning to drop i386
  support, so my x60 can sleep in peace tonight.
* A lot of ISOs to choose from. Netinst for network installation or
  even a full image.
* Lot of mirrors around the world. So apt downloads can be very fast.

But there's also bad stuff. 

* systemd by default. You can change it. But it is a very bad idea. If
  you want Debian without systemd. Use [Devuan](https://devuan.org),
  which is the distro I use (2020-06-05) (not anymore)
* apt is slow as fuck while unpackaging.
* same as dpkg
* Old packages if you don't use Debian testing/sid. Which is not a big
  problem since you can edit sources.list or install Debian testing
  directly.

That's all about Debian. Probably my favorite distro and you should
use it if you're new to GNU/Linux.
