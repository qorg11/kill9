Tor is an anonimity network that works with *nodes*. Each node is in a
random place in the world. 

Your computer picks a random nodes path. making it hard to guess who you are

A shitty thing about this is that your IP address will be shown to the
first node you visit. And traffic on it it's unencrypted.
