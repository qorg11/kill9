# Windows sucks

Windows is proprietary software so you don't have control over
it. Instead micr\*s\*ft has control over **YOU**
.
The following operating systems sucks:

* Windows 9x
* Windows 2000
* Windows xp
* Windows Vista
* Windows 7
* Windows 8/8.1
* Windows 10

Microsoft spies on you, puts ads on your system and charges you. Which
should be illegal. In fact spying on you should be illegal. 

Windows comes with installed program you didn't even asked for. which
is true bloatware. More bloated than the Linux kernel.

Windows sucks for development, you don't have any equivalent to, for
example /usr/include and you have to install bash/cygwin to get a
"GNU/Linux feeling"

Microsoft really hates standards, their products used not to be
compatible with most standards. Internet Explorer for example. GNU
software doesn't follows the standards at 100%, but GNU software does
add something useful to the software instead of making it a pain in
the ass.

# Backdoors

Is not a mistery for anyone that Win10 is absolutely backdoored. A
example of this is that [Microsoft disk encryption is
backdoored.](https://theintercept.com/2015/12/28/recently-bought-a-windows-computer-microsoft-probably-has-your-encryption-key/)
Since it stores the unlocking password in **your** Microsoft account.

If you try to install another browser (Firefox the one which rhymes
with "Noodle Dome") [it begs you not
to](https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/12/microsoft-intercepting-firefox-chrome-installation-on-windows-10/)

# Interference

Not allowing the user to install whatever he wants is very
shitty. It's my fucking computer! 

Not to mention when Microsoft forced the users to install
Windows 10. Sometimes without users knowing.

# Sabotage

[Windows update remove software
installed](http://www.ghacks.net/2015/11/24/beware-latest-windows-10-update-may-remove-programs-automatically/). For
example. If you upgrade windows, very likely the MBR will be
overwritten. So if you were dual-booting with GNU/Linux, prepare the
GRUB (or LILO) Fixer USB.

In Windows, a DRM files can be used to identify people using Tor.
The vulnerability only exists in Windows (Win-fags BTFO)

[Windows informs to the NSA about exploits before fixing
them](https://web.archive.org/web/20130622044225/http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2013/06/how-can-any-company-ever-trust-microsoft-again/index.htm)

Not to mention Windows upgrades without your consent. We already
talked about why automatically upgrades are bad:

* Remove useful features
* Add useless features
* Phones homes every time you open the software to check if upgrade is
  available (This is the reason I think package managers are the best
  thing that could ever happen to GNU/Linux. You upgrade if YOU
  want. You can read the changelog before upgrading)

Conclusion: Don't trust proprietary software. Especially in sensitive
subjects. Such as privacy, encryption...
