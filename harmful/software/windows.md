# Windows sucks

Windows is proprietary software so you don't have control over it. Instead
micr\*s\*ft has control over **YOU**. The following Windows operating
systems suck:

* Windows 9x
* Windows 2000
* Windows XP
* Windows Vista
* Windows 7
* Windows 8/8.1
* Windows 10
* Windows 11

Microsoft spies on you, puts ads on your system and charges you. Which
should be illegal. In fact spying on you should be illegal. 

Windows comes with preinstalled programs you didn't even asked for, which is
true bloatware. More bloated than the Linux kernel.

Windows sucks for development, you don't have any equivalent to, for
example /usr/include and you have to install bash/cygwin to get a
"GNU/Linux feeling".

Microsoft really hates standards, their products used not to be compatible
with most standards. Internet Explorer for example. GNU software doesn't
follows the standards at 100%, but GNU software does add something useful
to the software instead of making it a pain in the ass.

# Backdoors

Is not a mystery for anyone that Win10 is absolutely backdoored. A example
of this is that [Microsoft disk encryption is
backdoored.](https://theintercept.com/2015/12/28/recently-bought-a-windows-computer-microsoft-probably-has-your-encryption-key/)
Since it stores the unlocking password in **your** Microsoft account.

If you try to install another browser (Firefox the one which rhymes with
"Noodle Dome") [it begs you not
to](https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/12/microsoft-intercepting-firefox-chrome-installation-on-windows-10/)

# Interference

Not allowing the user to install any piece of software they want is very
shitty. It's my fucking computer! 

Not to mention that Microsoft forced their users to install Windows 10.
Sometimes without users knowing.

# Sabotage

[Windows update remove software
installed](http://www.ghacks.net/2015/11/24/beware-latest-windows-10-update-may-remove-programs-automatically/).
For example. If you upgrade windows, it's very likely that the MBR will be
overwritten. So if you were dual-booting with GNU/Linux, prepare the GRUB
(or LILO) Fixer USB.

In Windows, a DRM file can be used to identify people using Tor. The
vulnerability only exists in Windows. Win-fags BTFO.

[Windows informs to the NSA about exploits before fixing
them](https://web.archive.org/web/20130622044225/http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2013/06/how-can-any-company-ever-trust-microsoft-again/index.htm)

Not to mention Windows updates itself without your consent. We already talked
about why automatic upgrades are bad:

* Remove useful features
* Add useless features 
* Phones homes every time you open the software to check if upgrade is
  available (This is the reason I think package managers are the best thing
  that could ever happen to GNU/Linux. You upgrade if **YOU** want. You can read
  the changelog before upgrading.)

Conclusion: Don't trust any proprietary software. Especially in sensitive
subjects. Such as privacy, security, encryption...
