# Software considered harmful

In the sidebar on the left, you can find why i consider some points of
the software bad.

I don't think minimalistic software is all the times better than
bloated software. Sometimes "bloated" software is better than the
alternatives. For example pale moon is more usable than surf. And
sometimes extensions are useful so i don't consider them harmful,
problem is that how you write those extensions (if you read GNU source
code, you'll have a impulse to throw yourself into an active
volcano). While, for example, BSD implemented those extensions in a
sane way.

Here's a table with software i consider harmful and their alternaties

The programs here are worse than useless so they require no
alternative:

* Adobe Flash
* Microsoft Office
