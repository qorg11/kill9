# Matrix, Riot, Element, Synapse, Vector... I don't know how it is called anymore

Hey that's first problem! nobody knows how to find your service!

Go to your search engine and look up the following:

"Matrix"
"Element matrix"
"Matrix vector element"
"Element"

See? no related results of what we're talking about..

## Servers uses HTTP for it

What the hell? Why do a completly separate server use HTTP?

I mean, XMPP uses HTTP only for file upload and that's it (Also, the
HTTP upload file server is started by the XMPP server, not like
matrix, which depends on, let's say, nginx)

## Centralization

Yeah, Matrix is a decentralized protocol in theory, but in practice,
this is different:

* Everyone has their account in matrix.org
* Everyone uses element as their client, because all the others suck

## Client is written in Electron!

What else do I have to say?
