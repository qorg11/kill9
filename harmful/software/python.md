# Python is the worst programming language used nowadays

# Lacks everything

* No pointers.
* [No true multithreading](https://kill-9.xyz/thread.png)
* No ternary operators (no, ifes in one line are not ternary operators)
* No switch (if else if else if else if else if else if...)
* No constants
* It is a true miracle that Python has lambdas. (BTW you cannot give statements to a lambda. Which makes them very useless.)
* no goto (a well used goto is better than a horrible code)

# Versions hell

Python (Not these days) have two main versions 2.7 and 3.x. Syntax are quite different, for example:

~~~
print "Hello, I'm using a stupid programming language\n" # Python 2.7
print ("Hello, I'm using a stupid programming language\n") # Python 3.x
~~~

That means a python 2.7 code don't run on a python3 interpreter, and
python 3.0 don't run on a python2.7 interpreter.

Which is fine, but Python mantained python 2.7 for so long. It ended
support on 2020 and should not be used anymore. But [some
programmers](https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/+bug/1714107) do not
want to make the change.
