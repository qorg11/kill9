Basically. Tom was saying that HTML5 is bad, because it's **NOT**
standarized (Well, if you don't count whatever chromium is adding as
standard)

The true standard is XHTML 1.1 and you should write your websites to
be XHTML compliant. Rather than HTML 5 compliant.

The HTML5 "standard" is written by [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org)
(Apple, Google, Mozilla, Microsoft). (Sound like a fucking conspiracy,
huh)

It is not written by w3c (which have written the XHTML standard, and
for fuck's sake, standarized the web in the first place)
