# **GITHUB AND ITS CONSEQUENCES, A DISASTER FOR THE HUMAN RACE?**
## NO! IT'S EVEN WORSE!

First of all, github was adquired by [[[microsoft]]] so it began to
suck and most people moved to gitlab, which is also as harmful, but
here i'm shitting in github

first of all, the thing depends in JS stupidly, the fucking dates of
the repos are generated client-side (rather server side like any sane
git server would do) (gitea, gitweb and cgit do this) (Dunno about
gitlab)

Also, they use some kind of stupid JS which basically doesn't work
under pale moon, no seriously, i cannot use github in palemoon because
the things will simply not run. 

And well, isn't it ironic that github is proprietary but encourages
the sharing of source code? Well, always have been proprietary but
microsoft is probably making it more proprietary lol

GitHub is based in the Land of the Free (the place which you can call
yourself free, but cannot download a torrent, i mean United States),
it implies it can be DMCA'd

Well, youtube-dl, a very great program I use nearly every day, [got
dmca'd](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md)
for some reason i simply can't understand.

Why did it get dmca'd? literally no reason, youtube-dl is only a
program to download youtube videos (and from other sites). I guess
they dmca'd it because you can use it to download copyrighted
material, alright, then dmca'd all the browsers, because you can use
them to download (and view) copyrighted material
