# NodeJS sucks

It doomed a whole generation of programmers that thing that JS is a
good programming language that should be used for everything, with no
remorse for those old CPUs

JavaScript was enough pain in the browser, why bring it to desktop?

Its concunrrency sucks dick and balls, it teaches concurrency the
worst way possible (remember that it taught a generation of
programmers that JS is a good language, so the Youthâ„¢ will think that
such thing as multithreading is easy (even though nodejs runs in only
one thread). for example, it lacks mutex (because it is done
automatically) so programmers will never know what mutex it and get
fucked in the ass when they learn another language (which to be fair,
they will never will because they already have a stable job...)
