# markdown sucks!

(which is ironic since im writing this in markdown)

The markdown syntax sucks and it's unreadable, for example:

The \*quick\* \*\*brown\*\* fox jumps over the \*\*lazy\*\* dog

Translates to:

The *quick* **brown** fox jumps over the **lazy** dog

It's pretty unreadable to put both bolds and itallics with * because
it leads to confussion. because a normal person reads \*text between
asterisks\* as bold. not as /cursive/

In saner alternatives (org-mode for example) \*something\* goes to
**something** and /something/ goes to *something*

Not to mention that when markdown lacks something (because it's not
bloated!) you have to fallback to HTML.

## Alternatives

* plain text
* org-mode
* Jumping in the eye of a hurricane
