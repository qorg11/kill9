# Gemini sucks

* One line per paragraph, or, 1000 chars long lines.
* No images
* But there are emojis!
* Mandatory TLS (Which gives poor support for hidden services)

The problem with the modern web is a social problem, not a protocol
problem. HTTP is a "good" protocol. The problem is JS, not HTTP, the
problem is multicorps, not HTTP. For example, websites in the darknet,

they use HTTP, not gemini

# Alternatives

* http lmao
* gopher if you want to be edgy
* ftp
* telnet
* finger
