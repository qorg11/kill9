# Telegram sucks

Telegram sucks, I don't know why people think it is more secure than
other applications. Like [whatsapp](whatsapp) at least bothers on
encrypthing the messages (we don't konw if it is backdoored or
not. but  well at least it is)

# The client

In telegram, messages are not end-to-end encrypted so the russians who
operate it can read them.

>\>inb4 you can use secret chats in telegram which are encrypted.

Yes. Those secrets chats are enabled by default and supported fnord in
telegram-desktop.

For some reason I don't understand, telegram-desktop depends in a
wayland library (even though i'm using X) 

Then, you can use `telegram-cli` which is the most confusing thing
i've seen in a lot of time but it supports the secret chat thing

# The server

I don't know man. It is proprietary.

# The data it asks for

* Phone Number

Like, why? XMPP (for example), minimally, asks for a JID and that's
it. That's how other users will find you
