# Oh My ZSH considered harmful

>\>inb4 zoomer shell

(nothing wrong with the pure zsh)

In my soydev times. I used to use oh my zsh.

It had auto updated. Which fucking sucks because

* They add useless soykaf
* They remove useful soykaf
* They have to phone home to see if there's a new update. Which is
  clearly spyware.
