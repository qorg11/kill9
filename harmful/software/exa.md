>     exa - a modern replacement for ls

Oh, a repleacement for ls!

~~~
qorg@satania ~ > exa -p    
Unknown argument -p
~~~

Huh? Why can't I tell exa to put a / at the end of every directory?

~~~
qorg@satania ~> exa -s
Flag -s needs a value (choices: name, Name, size, extension, Extension, 
modified, changed, accessed, created, inode, type, none)
~~~

HUH?

What was wrong with ls(1)?

Plus it's written in Rust.
