# youtube sucks

* Bloated of JS
* The fucking player uses JS
* (Won't load without JS)

## Content sucks

Go to youtube.com, and see the trending bullshit (this depends on your
location, i'm asuming that you're from The Land of The Free™ and Home
of The Brave™) most of the shit are people either:

1. Shilling products they haven't even used
2. Complaining about youtube demonetizing their videos

(Obviously there are good content like computerphile i guess)

## Ebin gobyright :DDD

Freedom means nothing to me as long as there is DMCA

## Alternatives

* Peertube
* Mediagoblin
* Uploading literal .webm videos to your website...?
