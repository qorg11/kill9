# Brave browser sucks

It is just another chromium skin.

# It's private

Yes, it cares a lot of your privacy so the default browser is Google
and doesn't disable trackers for facebook or twitter

# It is chromium

Are you saying that as it was a good thing?

# Cryptos

I already said it, Brave is not a browser, it is a cryptominer which
happens to have a HTTP client

# Built in tor windows

Any browser can have this if you know how to configure a socks proxy
and change the user agent (I don't know if Brave does this last thing)
