# Taxation is theft!

>\>Weren't you leftist?!

Yes, let me explain

Why do **I** have to pay taxes? You know I'm working class I don't
have much money and I still have to pay taxes? Why do the poor pay
taxes instead of the rich? (remember that Amazon paid literally $0 in
taxes last year) 

Taxes should be paid by the rich class, not by the working class.

Also, what the hell is the State doing with my taxes?

Some shit seems to work, but other, ehh, as we know, **a**ll **c**ars
**a**re **b**arricades. No matter where you go, the police is useless.
